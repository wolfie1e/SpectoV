# SpectoV 
### What I changed:
The SpectoV homepage was redesigned with strategic enhancements to improve user experience and visual clarity. Key updates include a restructured navigation bar with better logo-name balance and more prominent buttons to guide interaction. Image and video sizes were reduced for optimal viewing, while the “Training Program” section was rephrased to be more engaging. The “Live Contests” section was expanded for greater detail, and course cards were meticulously realigned for a cleaner layout.

### Why I changed it:
These changes were made to address issues of clutter, vague content, and uneven alignment in the original design. The goal was to improve usability, responsiveness, and overall content clarity.

### How it improves the original:
The redesign delivers a more intuitive and visually polished experience. It enhances user engagement, improves discoverability, and creates a stronger first impression—helping attract new visitors and retain returning users while setting a solid foundation for future scalability and SEO optimization.
