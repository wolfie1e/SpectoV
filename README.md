Webpage Redesign: Key Enhancements
The redesigned webpage incorporates several strategic modifications aimed at enhancing user experience and visual appeal.

The navigation bar has been re-engineered for improved user-friendliness, featuring a balanced presentation of the company logo and name for optimal brand visibility. Additionally, buttons have been made more prominent to guide user interaction effectively.

Further improvements include a reduction in the size of images and videos, optimizing them for comfortable viewing and to immediately capture viewer attention. The "Training Program" section has been rephrased to be more engaging and appealing to potential users, and the "Live Contests" information has been expanded to provide greater detail and clarity.

Finally, the course cards have been meticulously aligned to present a cleaner, more organized layout. These changes collectively aim to create a more intuitive, visually appealing, and informative user journey.
